     <string name="infoThreeCliffBay"><![CDATA[This breathtakingly beautiful bay is situated on the south coast of the Gower Peninsula. So named for the three cliffs that jut into the bay, it\'s a perfect place for a walk or picnic. Although getting down to the beach can be a bit steep and cumbersome, the view is worth every step.\n\nMany tourists enjoy the spot so much, they park caravans nearby to enjoy a camping holiday. Others bring their dogs along to frolic in the water.
